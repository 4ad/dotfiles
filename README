This is my collection of dotfiles.  To install all the dotfiles run
INSTALL.  It will replace existing files.  INSTALL -p will print
what commands will be executed instead of executing them.

Files and directories that start with a dot lowercase letter
(not . or [A-Z]) are copied to $HOME appending a dot in
the front:

	file -> ~/.file
	dir(/dirn)+ -> ~/.dir/(dirn)+
	dir(/dirn)+/file -> ~/.dir/(dirn)+/file

Dependencies between files is handled by the files themselves.

INSTALL uses Plan9 sed because it has a simple syntax that is
easy to understand.  I won't bother dealing with idiosyncratic
UNIX or GNU sed.  If you don't have Plan9, sed copy the files
by hand or figure out the UNIX regular expression.  If you
do that please send me a patch.

Everything is under public domain, enjoy.
