This is my collection of dotfiles.  To install all the dotfiles run
install.sh.  It will replace existing files.  Every file resides in
its own directory.  To install only one file run make install in that
file's directory.  You need GNU make.  Running make instead of make
install will install the file in $DIR/bin.  You may wish to inspect
the file there before installing it in the user directory.  Running
make clean will remove $DIR/bin, running clean.sh will remove all
$DIR/bin directories.

When adding a new dotfile there are three important variables.

	TARG - required, the name of the file
	FINALTARG - optional, final name, defaults to .$TARG
	FINALDIR - optional, where it will be installed, defaults to HOME

Make concatenates $TARG with $TARG.$OS, $TARG.$ARCH and
$TARG.$HOSTNAME.  $TARG can be dynamically generated by a user
supplied rule.  You may specify $OS, $ARCH, $HOSTNAME and potentially
$FINALDIR to ``cross-compile'' a setup for a different machine.

Everything is under public domain, enjoy.
