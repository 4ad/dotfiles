This is my collection of dotfiles.  To install all the dotfiles run
INSTALL.  It will replace existing files.  INSTALL -p will print
what commands will be executed instead of executing them.

Files and directories that start with a dot lowercase letter
(not . or [A-Z]) are copied to $HOME appending a dot in
the front:

	file -> ~/.file
	dir(/dirn)+ -> ~/.dir/(dirn)+
	dir(/dirn)+/file -> ~/.dir/(dirn)+/file

Dependencies between files is handled by the files themselves.

Everything is under public domain, enjoy.
